uint8 input. 
No Mem parameter but option -s to trigger the use of a quadratic algorithm for the first 2^16 - 2^8 rules: discarded since it can be very slow: 48K seconds vs 2.7k even if the pspce was 22G vs 177GB
Non terminals are int32
Indexes with the input sequence are int64. prev/next fields in L are int64. Since the main array C[] can also store indices each entry is an int64_t. Replacing indices with with offsets we could store int32 in C (a gap larger than 2GB is unlikely)

uint8 input but easy to adapt to uint32 inputs
Input is always loaded into a uint32 sequence (so space 4n is required)
Uses the qudratic update algorithm until the full machinery for linear time 
update fits into maxMB.
Still have to check everything works when we have more than 2^31 symbols
(some variables storing symbols are int, so the sign could be a problem)
